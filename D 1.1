Certainly! Let's break down the tasks.

### Task 1:

sql
-- (0) Alter the table by adding a column Salary
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE ADD COLUMN Salary INTEGER;

-- (i) Alter the table by modifying the column Name
ALTER TABLE EMPLOYEE MODIFY COLUMN Name VARCHAR(size_of_updated_Name);

-- () Describe the table employee
DESCRIBE EMPLOYEE;

-- Rename table employee as emp
RENAME TABLE EMPLOYEE TO emp;

-- Delete the Second row from the table
DELETE FROM emp WHERE S.No = 2;

-- Drop the table
DROP TABLE emp;


### Task 2:

sql
-- Given the table EMPLOYEE (EmpNo, Name, Bank name, Address, Bank location, Branch name)
-- Write a cursor program using MySQL to select the Bank names from the table.
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetBankNames()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE bank_name VARCHAR(size_of_Bank_name);

    DECLARE cur CURSOR FOR SELECT `Bank name` FROM EMPLOYEE;
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;

    OPEN cur;

    read_loop: LOOP
        FETCH cur INTO bank_name;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE read_loop;
        END IF;

        -- Process the bank_name as needed (print, store, etc.)
        SELECT bank_name;
    END LOOP;

    CLOSE cur;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Call the procedure to execute the cursor
CALL GetBankNames();


### Task 3:

sql
-- Given the table CUSTOMERS (CustomerID, CustomerName, Address, Postal Code, Country)
-- Write a procedure to display the customer names using the table
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE DisplayCustomerNames()
BEGIN
    SELECT CustomerName FROM CUSTOMERS;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Call the procedure to display customer names
CALL DisplayCustomerNames();


### Task 4:

sql
-- Create a table BANK with the field description S.No as integer, Cust_Name as varchar,
-- Acc no as varchar, Balance as integer, Cus Branch as varchar
CREATE TABLE BANK (
    `S.No` INTEGER,
    Cust_Name VARCHAR(size_of_Cust_Name),
    `Acc no` VARCHAR(size_of_Acc_no),
    Balance INTEGER,
    `Cus Branch` VARCHAR(size_of_Cus_Branch)
);

-- Perform the following operations
-- (i) Select with where clause and Select with comparison operator > Select with between in the field Balance
SELECT * FROM BANK WHERE `Cus Branch` = 'Adyar';

SELECT * FROM BANK WHERE Balance > 120000;

SELECT * FROM BANK WHERE Balance BETWEEN 100000 AND 200000;

-- (ii) Update the Cus Branch in the second row as Poonamallee
UPDATE BANK SET `Cus Branch` = 'Poonamallee' WHERE `S.No` = 2;


Remember to replace size_of_... with the appropriate sizes for your data types.
