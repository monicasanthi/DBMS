### Task 1:

#### (i) Create a table STUDENT
sql
CREATE TABLE STUDENT (
    RegNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    Gender VARCHAR(10),
    DOB DATE,
    MobileNo VARCHAR(15),
    City VARCHAR(50)
);


#### (ii) Create a table FACULTY
sql
CREATE TABLE FACULTY (
    FacNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FacName VARCHAR(50),
    Gender VARCHAR(10),
    DOB DATE,
    DOJ DATE,
    MobileNo VARCHAR(15)
);


#### (iii) Create a table DEPARTMENT
sql
CREATE TABLE DEPARTMENT (
    DeptNo INT PRIMARY KEY,
    DeptName VARCHAR(50),
    DeptHead VARCHAR(50)
);


### Task 2:

#### (i) List the departments where the faculty members are working (Using INNER JOIN)
sql
SELECT DISTINCT D.DeptName
FROM DEPARTMENT D
INNER JOIN FACULTY F ON D.DeptNo = F.DeptNo;


#### (ii) Find the student who has no score in any of the courses. List student name and course number. (Using LEFT JOIN)
sql
SELECT S.Name, C.CourseNumber
FROM STUDENT S
LEFT JOIN SCORES SC ON S.RegNo = SC.RegNo
LEFT JOIN COURSE C ON SC.CourseCode = C.CourseCode
WHERE SC.CourseCode IS NULL;


#### (iii) The office clerk needs the names of the courses taken by the faculty belonging to "ECE department whose name is 'Kamal". (Using INNER JOIN)
sql
SELECT F.FacName, C.CourseName
FROM FACULTY F
INNER JOIN DEPARTMENT D ON F.DeptNo = D.DeptNo
INNER JOIN COURSE C ON D.DeptName = 'ECE' AND F.FacName = 'Kamal' AND C.DeptNo = D.DeptNo;


### Task 3:

sql
-- Assuming you want to retrieve email-ids, you should have an 'Email' column in the EMPLOYEE table.

-- Create a sample table
CREATE TABLE EMPLOYEE (
    EmpNo INT,
    Name VARCHAR(50),
    BankName VARCHAR(50),
    Address VARCHAR(50),
    BankLocation VARCHAR(50),
    BranchName VARCHAR(50),
    Email VARCHAR(50)
);

-- Sample data
INSERT INTO EMPLOYEE VALUES
(1, 'John Doe', 'ABC Bank', '123 Main St', 'City1', 'Branch1', 'john@example.com'),
(2, 'Jane Smith', 'XYZ Bank', '456 Oak St', 'City2', 'Branch2', 'jane@example.com');

-- Cursor program to retrieve email-ids
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetEmailIds()
BEGIN
    DECLARE done BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
    DECLARE email_id VARCHAR(50);

    -- Declare cursor
    DECLARE email_cursor CURSOR FOR SELECT Email FROM EMPLOYEE;

    -- Declare handler for not found
    DECLARE CONTINUE HANDLER FOR NOT FOUND SET done = TRUE;

    -- Open the cursor
    OPEN email_cursor;

    -- Fetch and print email-ids
    email_loop: LOOP
        FETCH email_cursor INTO email_id;
        IF done THEN
            LEAVE email_loop;
        END IF;

        -- Process the email_id as needed (print, store, etc.)
        SELECT email_id;
    END LOOP;

    -- Close the cursor
    CLOSE email_cursor;
END //

DELIMITER ;

-- Call the procedure to execute the cursor
CALL GetEmailIds();


Replace the table structure and data with your actual EMPLOYEE table structure and data.

### Task 4:

Creating an ER diagram and related SQL queries for a Student Progress Monitoring System would depend on specific details about the entities, relationships, and attributes in your scenario. Here's a generic outline:

#### General ER Diagram Structure:

- Entities: Student, Course, Faculty, Department, Score, etc.
- Relationships: Student enrolls in Course, Course is taught by Faculty, Department offers Course, etc.
- Attributes: StudentID, FacultyID, DepartmentID, CourseID, ScoreID, etc.

#### Sample SQL Query:

sql
-- Example query to get students and their enrolled courses
SELECT Student.StudentName, Course.CourseName
FROM Student
JOIN Enrollment ON Student.StudentID = Enrollment.StudentID
JOIN Course ON Enrollment.CourseID = Course.CourseID;


For a more accurate ER diagram and related SQL queries, I would need detailed information about your Student Progress Monitoring System scenario.
